Custom Fedora Atomic Image for personal computers.

# Purpose

This image is built on [Bazzite](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite). I use my computer for both gaming and coding, so while Bazzite is great for gaming, I require some additional things. This image includes various packages I always end up installing.

# Includes

## Packages

- VS Code

## System Flatpaks

- Brave Browser
- Discord (Vesktop)
- Telegram
- Syncthingy
